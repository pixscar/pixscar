## 💡 About Me
I'm an extremely curious person with a strong scientific background. I discovered in software development a field that truly satisfies my desire to understand, improve, and learn every day. Each project is an opportunity to apply what I learn in a concrete way, with attention to detail, critical thinking, and method.

🧠 I’m passionate about how programming combines logic, precision, and creativity. I enjoy analyzing problems and looking for functional solutions that make sense both in code and for those who use it.
